    "q": "3) How do cyclical annealing strategies compare with linear ones, based on Figure 4?",
    "options": [
      "A) Cyclical methods are superior for jazz pattern creation due to their complexity.",
      "B) Linear and cyclical methods provide similar results; no clear advantage can be determined from the figure alone. (Correct Answer).",
      "C) Linear annealing strategies produce more coherent drum patterns with less variation.",
      "D) The document does not compare different annealing strategies effectively in Figure 4."
