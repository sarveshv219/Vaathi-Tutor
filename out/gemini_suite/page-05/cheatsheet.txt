**Quality Assessment for Jazz Patterns in Generative Models: Cheatsheet**

- **Definitions & Key Concepts:**
   - Quality assessment: Evaluate if patterns sound musical, specifically jazz. [c]
     *Realistic timing* and structure are hallmarks of quality jazz output (see Fig 3).
   
- **Rhythmic Features to Monitor:**
   - Syncopation levels should be prominent for authenticity in jazz rhythm generation (see sample patterns with syncopated notes [Figure not provided]).
   - Variability is crucial; avoid monotonous repetition without variation. ✅ Ensure noticeable differences between consecutive samples within a set.
   
- **Annealing Strategies:**
   - *Cyclical Annealing* (top): Gradual cooling followed by intermittent reheating to explore different patterns, potentially enhancing complexity and musicality of generated jazz rhythms ([Figure 4]).
   - *Linear Annealing* (bottom): Steady reduction in randomness over time for controlled pattern evolution; may produce smoother transitions but risk losing the characteristic 'bite' of jazz.
   
- **Steps to Evaluate Quality:**
  1. Compare generated patterns with real-world examples, focusing on rhythmic complexity and structure ([Figure 3] as reference).
  2. Analyze for syncopation—a key jazz trait (no visual provided; referential cue to Figures not shown in this snippet): Jazz Rhythm Checker Tool or similar software can be used, inputting generated patterns to visually and audibly inspect syncopated notes' placement relative to the beat.
  3. Examine variation between consecutive samples within a pattern set (one-line example: "Check for distinct note timings").
  4. Evaluate annealing strategy effectiveness in capturing jazz essence; prefer cyclical strategies that yield diverse patterns with noticeable syncopation and complexity ([Figure 4]).
