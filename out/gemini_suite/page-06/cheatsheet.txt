## Cheatsheet on Annealing Techniques in Generative Music Algorithms

**Definitions and Key Concepts:**

- **Cyclical Annealing (CA):** Alternates constraint application between periods to maintain diversity. [Definition & Benefit] Maintains 2–3× higher pattern diversity, produces musically coherent outputs; alternates KL constraint with breaks for variety preservation.
- **Linear Annealing (LA):** Steps monotonically towards final objective without resetting constraints. [Formula: \(x_{t+1} = x_t + \alpha(1 - x_t)\)] Often leads to premature collapse and repetitive patterns, less diversity preservation; may result in musically disjointed outputs or homogeneity within the generated piece if misapplied.

**Key Formulas:**

- **Cyclical Annealing (CA): No specific formula but follows a pattern of alternating constraint application and relaxation over iterations [Rule of Thumb] Avoid monotonic increase; ensure variability to preserve musical coherence through periodic breaks from the KL constraint.
- **Linear Annealing:** Typically no explicit annealing schedule for music generation, as it does not inherently support diversity preservation in generative processes [Formula & Rule of Thumb] Avoid without additional measures like mutation or restarting; may lead to less diverse outputs unless supplemented with other techniques.

**Steps:**
1. Initialize the annealing process and select a suitable method (CA, LA).
2. For CA: [Step 1a] Apply KL constraint at designated intervals while allowing for periods of relaxation without constraints; monitor pattern diversity to ensure sustained variety in outputs throughout iterations. Adjust interval frequency based on desired output variance levels.
3. For LA: Monitor the progression closely, as it lacks inherent mechanisms to promote musical coherence and may require supplementary techniques for achieving diverse yet harmonious results; employ additional steps like random mutations or diversity-promoting callbacks if necessary. [Step 1b]
4. Evaluate the output against desired criteria (diversity, musicianship) post each iteration cycle to make adjustments in real time and iteratively refine annealing parameters for optimal results.
5. Iterate until reaching termination conditions or achieving a satisfactory level of musical quality within outputs; document iterations' effects on diversity preservation and output coherence, providing insights into the efficacy of chosen method(s) over various parameter settings.
