    "q": "1) According to the context, which of these methods helped in preventing posterior collapse?",
    "options": [
      "A) KL annealing alone.",
      "B) Combination of free bits and latent variation experiments.",
      "C) Free bits only without latent dimension control.",
      "D) Latent variation experiments with complexity control techniques like humanization."

  {
    "q": "2) What can be inferred about the influence of a single latent dimension based on this context?",
    "options": [
      "A) It has no effect on generated patterns and instrument activation.",
      "B) Altering it does not change pattern density or musical properties such as timing.",
      "C) Sweeping one dimension affects both pattern density and specific aspects like timing and instrument usage.",
      "D) A single latent dimension solely controls the color variation in outputs without changing other attributes."

  {
    "q": "3) How would you describe the result of humanization experiments on generated patterns?",
    "options": [
      "A) They led to no discernible changes from input noise.",
      "B) Subtle timing and instrument alterations emerged that align with a musical context when varied across latent dimensions.",
      "C) Humanized outputs showed increased dissimilarity in melody but constant rhythm between variations.",
      "D) The results indicated improved pitch accuracy without affecting the pattern or tempo variability."
