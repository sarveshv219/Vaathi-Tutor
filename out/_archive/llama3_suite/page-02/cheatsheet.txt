Here is a concise cheatsheet for RAW and OCR:

**RAW**

* **Definitions:**
 + Mode collapse: when the generator converges to limited modes.
 + Training stability: when loss curves and coverage metrics show minimal oscillation.

* **Key Formulas:**
 None

* **Rules of Thumb:**
 - Epoch 20-30: mode collapse begins, sharp decline in coverage.
 - Epoch 0-10: high apparent coverage due to random initialization diversity.
 - Epoch 50+: stabilization with reduced coverage levels and persistent mode limitations.

* **Steps:**

1. Monitor training dynamics from epoch 0-10.
2. Track mode collapse from epoch 20-30.
3. Evaluate training stability from epoch 50+.

**OCR**

* **Definitions:**
 None

* **Key Formulas:**
 None

* **Rules of Thumb:**
 None

* **Steps:**

1. Analyze the graph with a line graph and a bar graph for patterns or trends.
2. Identify key features, such as mode collapse or training stability.

Note: Since OCR is not well-defined in the context provided, I couldn't include specific rules of thumb or steps. If you provide more information about OCR, I can help create a more detailed cheatsheet.
