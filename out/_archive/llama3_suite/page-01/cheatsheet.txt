Here is a concise cheatsheet based on the provided context:

**Definitions**

• Mode collapse: When the model fails to generate diverse outputs due to limited training data.
• Feature-matching GAN (FM-GAN): A variant of GAN that uses feature matching loss for better letter diversity.

**Key Formulas**

• Feature matching loss: L = ∑(f(x) - f(y))^2, where f(x) and f(y) are feature representations.

• Vanilla GAN loss: D(x) - 1 + log(P(x)), where D is the discriminator and P(x) is the probability distribution.

**Rules of Thumb**

• Sharper edges → Easier to learn → More frequent appearance.
• Smoother shapes → Harder to learn → Less frequent appearance.

**Steps for Feature-Matching GAN**

• Train discriminator on letter features
• Train generator on feature-matching loss
• Use feature matching loss to encourage diversity

**Quantitative Comparison**

• Vanilla GAN: ~0.6-0.7 coverage
• FM-GAN: ~0.7-0.8 coverage (improved letter diversity)

**Visual Quality Assessment**

• FM-GAN produces more recognizable letter shapes.

Note: The cheatsheet is designed to be concise and easy to revise quickly, using one-line bullets and key definitions, formulas, rules of thumb, and steps for the feature-matching GAN.
