Here is a concise cheatsheet based on the context:

**RAW Figure 4**

* Definition: Figure 4 represents the results of KL annealing for posterior collapse prevention.

Key Formulas:
• KL divergence: measures difference between predicted and true distributions
• Free bits: added to prevent mode collapse in latent spaces

Rules of Thumb:
• Nonzero KL and diverse outputs indicate successful posteror collapse prevention.
• Latent variation experiments control complexity, humanization, and instrument usage.

Steps:
1. Apply KL annealing to model.
2. Monitor nonzero KL and diverse outputs for posterior collapse prevention.
3. Perform latent variation experiments to control complexity, humanization, and instrument usage.

**Problem 2 Analysis**

* Definition: Problem 2 analysis involves interpreting the results of KL annealing for posteror collapse prevention.

Key Formulas:
• Latent dimension interpretation: each dimension controls a distinct musical property (density, timing, instrument usage).

Rules of Thumb:
• Sweeping a single latent dimension alters pattern density and instrument activation.
• Humanization experiment shows subtle timing and instrument changes from latent noise.

Steps:
1. Analyze results of KL annealing for posteror collapse prevention.
2. Interpret each latent dimension's control over musical properties (density, timing, instrument usage).
3. Perform humanization experiments to understand the effects of latent noise on instrument usage and timing.
