Let's break down what this page is saying in simple terms.

Here are the key points:

• When we try to give a new style to music, but still keep its rhythm, most of the time it works really well. (Think of it like trying to change your friend's outfit, but still keeping their shoes.)
• If we take a look at some examples (Figure 5), we can see that this style transfer is successful in many cases, with over 80% success rate across different genres.
• What's great about the models is that they not only adapt the style, but also keep the core rhythm intact. It's like finding the right balance between changing your friend's clothes and keeping their shoes on!
• The best part? These models can even maintain consistency within each genre, making sure the new style still feels true to its roots.

In short, when it comes to giving a new style to music while preserving its rhythm, most of the time it works really well, and the models are getting better at it!
