c) Quality assessment:  
- Generated jazz patterns show realistic timing and structure.  
- Rhythms capture traits like syncopation, complexity.  
- Each sample is rhythmically coherent with noticeable variation.

d) Comparison of different annealing strategies:  
- Figure 4 compares cyclical (top) vs linear (bottom) annealing in generated drum patterns.
