- Letters like A, C, and G are more likely to appear because their sharp edges make them easier for the model to recognize.
- Letters such as X, Y, and Z have some presence in the output, indicating the model didn't completely ignore them despite mode collapse.
- Using a feature-matching model helps maintain diversity with letters like O that have smoother shapes.
- In comparison tests, a feature-matching GAN produced more recognizable letter shapes compared to a vanilla GAN.
- The vanilla GANâ€™s coverage dropped to around 0.6-0.7 while the feature-matching version maintained at about 0.7-0.8.

Summary:
The key finding is that using a feature-matching model helps keep letters with smoother shapes like O in the output, resulting in better overall letter diversity and visual quality.
