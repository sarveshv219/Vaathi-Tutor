    "q": "What prevented posterior collapse in the model?",
    "a": "KL annealing and free bits prevented posterior collapse, as shown by nonzero KL and diverse outputs (see Figure 1)."

    "q": "How can latent dimensions be interpreted in terms of their control over generated patterns?",
    "a": "Sweeping a single latent dimension alters pattern density and instrument activation (see Figure 2). Each latent controls a distinct musical property, such as density, timing, or instrument usage. Humanization experiment shows subtle changes in these properties from latent noise."

    "q": "What is the relationship between posterior collapse and model behavior when collapsed?",
    "a": "If the model had collapsed, all patterns would look identical regardless of latent input (see Figure 2)."
