Certainly! Here's a concise cheatsheet based on your provided context:

- **Stabilization Technique**:
  - Measures: Both metrics and visual quality improved.
  - Function: Prevents discriminator overpowering by matching intermediate feature distributions.
  - Generated samples: Better letter recognition, reduced artifacts compared to vanilla baseline.
  - Training curves: More stable convergence with less oscillation.

Please note that the OCR context about cancer graphs appears unrelated. If you need a cheatsheet for stabilization techniques only, here it is:

- **Stabilization Technique**:
  - Improves both metrics and visual quality.
  - Prevents discriminator overpowering by matching feature distributions.
  - Generates better samples with improved letter recognition and reduced artifacts.
  - Training curves show more stable convergence with fewer oscillations.
