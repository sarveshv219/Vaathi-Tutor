- Figure 5 demonstrates that electronic music samples can maintain their original rhythm while successfully changing the style.
- The model was able to adapt the sound's characteristics without altering its fundamental beat structure, showing high success rates in different genres.
- Observations indicate that the model could seamlessly switch between various styles like pop, techno, and jazz while keeping the core rhythmic pattern consistent.
- It suggests a powerful music synthesis technique where even when changing the tone or genre of songs, the underlying beats remain recognizably themselves.
- Summary: Figure 5 illustrates how advanced models can transform electronic music's style without losing its essential rhythm, proving their effectiveness across different genres.
