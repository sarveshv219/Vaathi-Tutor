[CHEATSHEET]

- **Figure 5**: Electric samples with consistent rhythm and successful style transfer.
- **Success Rate**: High (>80%) observed across all tested genres.
- **Core Observation**: Model maintains genre-specific style consistency while preserving rhythmic content.
- **Key Formula**: Not explicitly numerical, but based on model performance metrics (e.g., accuracy or similarity scores).
- **Rule of Thumb**: Successful transfer indicates clear adaptation of style with intact rhythm structure.
- **Steps**:
  1. Analyze core rhythmic elements in samples
  2. Evaluate style adaptation fidelity
  3. Assess overall transfer success based on model performance metrics
