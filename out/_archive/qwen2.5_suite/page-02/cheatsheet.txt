[CHEATSHEET]

- Training stability: Less loss curve oscillation, better metrics.
- Mode collapse begins around epoch 20-30, marked by sharp decline in coverage (Fig. 3).
- Early epochs (0-10): High apparent coverage due to random initialization.
- Mid-training (20-50): Critical period of generator convergence to limited modes.
- Late training (50+): Stabilized at reduced coverage with persistent mode limitations.
