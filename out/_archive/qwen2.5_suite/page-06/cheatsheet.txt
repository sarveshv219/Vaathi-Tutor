- **Cyclical Annealing**:
  - Alternates between 0 and 1, maintaining diversity.
  - Key Formula: No direct formula, cycles through states.

- **Linear Annealing**:
  - Increases linearly from 0 to 1, often premature collapse and repetition.
  - Key Formula: Not applicable; follows a monotonic increase.

- **Comparison**:
  - Cyclical Annealing: Higher pattern diversity (2–3×), more musically coherent outputs.
  - Linear Annealing: Premature collapse, repetitive patterns.
