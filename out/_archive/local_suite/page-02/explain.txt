Bullets:
- Training stability benefits from reduced oscillation in loss curves.
- Mode collapse begins between epochs 20-30, indicated by sharp decline in coverage (Figure 3).
- High apparent coverage observed early on due to diversity of random initialization.
- Critical period for mode collapse is mid-training, with the generator converging to limited modes around epochs 20-50.
- Late training reveals stabilization at lower coverage levels despite persistent mode limitations.

Summary:
The study highlights key periods in neural network training where stability and diversity are most affected, pinpointing early stages of high apparent coverage due to initialization variance, a critical mid-training collapse period leading to limited modes generation by the generator around epochs 2tyes, followed by late stabilization at reduced coverage despite limitations.
