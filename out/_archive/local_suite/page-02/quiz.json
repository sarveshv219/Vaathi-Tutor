    "q": "1. What is the trend in training stability as observed from epochs 0-50?",
    "options": [
      "A) It consistently improves throughout the epochs without oscillation.",
      "B) Stability initially increases but begins to show less improvement and more oscillation around epoch 20, leading into a critical collapse period where generator converges on limited modes between epochs 20-50.",
      "C) Collapse occurs immediately after initial training with minimal coverage throughout the remaining epochs.",
      "D) Stability is unaffected by loss curves or mode convergence in this range of epochs."

    "q": "2. Around which epochs does the onset of collapse become evident?",

      "A) 0-10",
      "B) 20-30",
      "C) 40-50",
      "D) After 60"

  },
  {
    "q": "3. What characterizes early epochs (0-1 endpoints and diversity)?",
    "options": [
      "A) Consistently low coverage due to random initialization with no apparent convergence in generator modes.",
      "B) High apparent coverage initially, attributed to the diverse range of outputs from initial training that creates a facade of successful learning despite not being indicative of true stability or improvement.",
      "C) Collapse is already occurring during this period as indicated by declining loss metrics and lack of diversity in generator output modes.",
      "D) Steady coverage levels with clear mode convergence patterns emerging right from the start, signaling a stable training process."
