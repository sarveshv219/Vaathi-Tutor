    "q": "1. According to Figure 4, what improvements does feature-matching stabilization demonstrate?",
    "options": [
      "A) Decreased visual quality in images but improved metric consistency",
      "B) Measurable improvements in both metrics and visual quality with fewer oscillations during training",
      "C) Reduced artifacts only without affecting the recognition of letters or image stability",
      "D) Improved letter recognition, reduced artifacts, increased overall noise within generated samples"

  {
    "q": "2. How does feature-matching stabilization prevent discriminator overpowering?",
    "options": [
      "A) By using a different algorithm altogether for training the model",
      "B) Through matching intermediate output distributions of both networks to maintain balance",
      "C) It doesn't; it just prevents oscillation in generated images",
      "D) The technique uses external data normalization methods exclusively"

  {
    "q": "3. What does Figure 5 indicate about the convergence behavior when using feature-matching stabilization during training?",
    "options": [
      "A) There are more frequent overpowering occurrences by discriminators than in baseline models",
      "B) Convergence is unstable with increased oscillations seen often in vanilla approaches",
      "C) Feature-matching leads to a stable convergence pattern with reduced and less erratic oscillation patterns observed",
      "D) The training process becomes slower, leading to more extended periods of overpowering by the discriminator"
