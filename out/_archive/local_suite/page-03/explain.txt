- Feature-matching stabilization improves visual quality.

- It reduces discriminator overpowering by matching feature distributions.

- Better letter recognition in generated samples; fewer artifacts than baseline.

- More stable convergence with reduced oscillations during training (see Figure 4).

Summary: Feature-matching stabilization enhances OCR visual quality, increases sample accuracy, and achносит more stable model convergence compared to the vanilla approach.
