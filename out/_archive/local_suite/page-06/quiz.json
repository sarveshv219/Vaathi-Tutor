      "A) Cyclical annealing maintains higher pattern diversity than linear annealing does. [Ans: A]",
      "B) Linear annealing maintains higher pattern diversity due to its monotonic increase. [C]",

    "q": "2. Which aspect is often a downside of using linear annealing?",
    "options": [
      "A) It leads to premature collapse, causing repetitive patterns in the output. [Ans: A]",
      "B) Cyclical annealing takes too long for practical use due to its non-monotonic nature. [C]",
      "C) Linear annealing maintains a consistent pattern without any diversity throughout. [D]"

    "q": "3. How does cyclical annealing differ from linear annealing in terms of the KL constraint?",
    "options": [
      "A) Cyclical annealing gives periodic breaks, sustaining both musically coherent outputs and diversity. [Ans: A]",
      "B) Linear annealing has no impact on pattern repetition or breaking constraints with time progression. [C]",
      "C) Both cyclical and linear methods of annealing completely remove the KL constraint during processing. [D]"
