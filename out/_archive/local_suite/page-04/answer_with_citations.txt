Figure [Slide 4, Slide 5] shows that different annealing strategies affect drum patterns differently; cyclical (top) vs linear (bottom). Figure [Slide 3] demonstrates the model's ability to transfer style while preserving rhythm across genres with high success rates. Moreover, Figures [Slide 2], which illustrate experiments on complexity control and humanization through altering latent dimensions, reveal that each dimension controls a distinct musical property such as density or timing (referenced in Figure [Slide 1]). Lastly, Figure [Slide 3] provides an assessment of generated patterns' sound quality by showing jazz samples with realistic traits like syncopation and coherent rhythms.
