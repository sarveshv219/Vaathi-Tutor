The effectiveness of feature-matching stabilization technique is evidenced by its ability to improve both quantitative metrics and visual quality, as shown in Figure 4 [Slide 3]. It effectively prevents discriminator overpowering through intermediate feature matching. Moreover, it enhances letter recognition while reducing artifacts when compared with the vanilla baseline [Slide 3]. The technique also promotes more stable convergence during training and reduces oscillation patterns observed in Figure 5 [Slide 4], suggesting overall improved learning stability for generative models using this method [Slide 5, Slide 6].
