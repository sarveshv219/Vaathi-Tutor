Evaluation of Stabilization Technique's Effectiveness
- Feature-matching stabilization improves both quality metrics and visual appearance.
- The technique mitigates discriminator overpowering by aligning feature distributions.
- Better letter recognition is observed, with fewer artifacts in generated samples compared to the baseline.
- More stable convergence seen through reduced oscillation patterns on training curves.
