- Cyclical annealing alternates between states, giving periodic breaks from the KL constraint.

- Linear annealing increases continuously but often leads to premature collapse and repetitive patterns.

- Compared with cyclical methods, linear ones maintain significantly lower pattern diversity and less coherence in outputs.

Summary: 
Cyclical annealing enhances output variety while preventing the decline associated with continuous improvement techniques like linear annealing.
