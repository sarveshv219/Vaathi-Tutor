The analysis in [Slide 2] discusses how KL annealing combined with free bits helped avoid posterior collapse, which is when all outputs become indistinguinishable despite varied latent inputs. This was evident through nonzero KL divergence and diverse patterns produced (refer to Figure 1). It also mentions that experiments in [Slide 3] demonstrate distinct changes induced by varying a single latent dimension for complexity control or humanization, each affecting specific musical attributes like density and instrument choice without collapsing the diversity of outputs.
