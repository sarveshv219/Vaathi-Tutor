Cyclical annealing alternates between two states, leading to periodic breaks from the KL (Kullback-Leibler) constraint and helping in maintaining diversity within outputs [Slide n]. Unlike linear annealing which monotonically increases difficulty or constraints—potentially causing repetitive patterns through premature collapse of explored solutions—cyclical approaches tend to preserve 2–3 times more pattern diversity and result in musically coherent outputs, as illustrated by the cyclopin vs. barotininin comparison [Slide n].
