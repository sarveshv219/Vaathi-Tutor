- KL annealing along with free bits prevented posterior collapse, indicated by nonzero KL divergence.

- Evidence of diversity in outputs due to interventions like complexity control and humanization experiments is observed.

- Single latent dimension manipulation results in different patterns' density and instrument activation variation (complexity control).

- Latent dimensions independently learn various musical properties, with the experiment confirming these effects through controlled variations of timing and instruments during Humanization trials.

Summary:
Annealing techniques prevent posterior collapse by maintaining diversity within outputs; latent variables individually affect distinct aspects like density and instrument usage in generated patterns.
