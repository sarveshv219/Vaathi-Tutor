TEST PLAN: After uploading a PDF with 7 pages

1. Invalid Citations Bug - FIXED:
   - Old: Could show "Jump to Slide 116" for a 7-page document
   - New: Validates page_id is within [0, total_pages) range
   - Logs warning if invalid page_id detected

2. Vague Figure Answers - IMPROVED:
   - Old: LLM was ignoring CAPTIONS section in slide contexts
   - New: Prompt explicitly tells LLM to "Pay special attention to CAPTIONS sections"
   - New: Prompt tells LLM "these describe figures/images in the slides"
   - Citations limited to top 5 most relevant slides
   - Context increased from 300 to 500 chars per slide

3. How Image Captions Work:
   - PDF ingestion extracts images using PyMuPDF
   - Each image is captioned using BLIP (Salesforce/blip-image-captioning-base)
   - Captions are merged into page_context as:
     RAW:
     {text from PDF}
     
     OCR:
     {OCR if needed}
     
     CAPTIONS:
     {image caption 1}
     {image caption 2}
   
   - This page_context is stored in vector index
   - When answering questions, relevant contexts (with captions) are retrieved
   - LLM now pays attention to CAPTIONS section

To Test:
1. Upload a 7-page PDF with figures
2. Ask "what is in the figure in this page"
3. Expected: 
   - Answer should reference actual captions/figure content from slides
   - Citations should only be slides 1-7
   - No "Jump to Slide 116" or other invalid slides
